/// @dev The Heinz bet is a six-selection bet consisting of 57 bets: 15 doubles, 20 trebles, 15 fourfolds, six fivefolds and a one sixfold accumulator. Aptly named after the 57 ‘varieties’ company slogan from Heinz, this 57 bet wager is a unique bet that combines every permutation of the 6 selections into one single wager.
